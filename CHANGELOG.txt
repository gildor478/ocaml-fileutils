v0.4.0:
  * Simplify interface, avoid nested module when possible:
    * Add filename information to all exception
    * FileUtil:
      * size is now a 64bits integer, functions are restricted to 4 most useful
        operations
      * Str match is now separated into another module (FileUtilStr, package
        fileutils-str)
      * All operations are now directly in FileUtil and not in FileUtil.StrUtil
    * FilePath:
      * Remove is_implicit, use is_relative as replacement
      * All functions of FilePath.DefaultPath are now directly accessible in
        FilePath 
      * Default operation on string, use sub-module Abstract for abstract
        operations 
       * FilePath.reduce don't reduce ".." except if asked to (i.e. no symlink)
       * CygwinPath related function use directly UnixPath
  * Make documentation more clear
  * Introduce fast operation for string filename: when possible to operate
    directly on string use it
  * Drop parser/lexer for path: this is complicated and not efficient. Prefer
    simple string manipulation which is more efficient
  * Replace build system by ocamlbuild, ocamlfind, a simple Makefile,
    ocaml-autoconf macros and configure
  * Adapt compilation and test to Windows
  * Simplify rm and avoid asking question twice (Closes: #FS79)
  * Use Unix.LargeFile to handle huge file (Closes: FS#77)
  * Simplify size operation. Now all operation is done on Int64 (Closes: FS#76)
  * Implement FileUtilStr that allow Str.regexp match outside the core 
    FileUtil module (Closes: FS#13)
  * Add a wildcard on .a and .lib to allow installation on Windows 
    (Closes: FS#84)
  * Update license header (Closes: FS#8, FS#55)
  * Accept "/" as separator for Win32 (Closes: FS#78, FS#83, FS#68)
  * For win32, use PATHEXT to locate executable with "which" (Closes: FS#73)
  * Don't suppose ".." can be reduced and test it (Closes: FS#10)
  * Fix "mv" and allow to copy data between filesystem (Closes: FS#6, FS#7)
  * Optimize FileUtil.find speed, now only 2x slower than UNIX find (was 40x slower before) 
    (Closes: FS#65)

v0.3.0: 
  * Change the version to 0.3 (lot of changes for a minor version)
  * Update webpages
  * Correct a bug that prevent sr\@Ltn to be parsed (which comes from the
    lexer of UnixPath, there is [^'.''/''\\']* which can produce empty token)
  * Correct a bug that prevent to parse the initial current dir (ie produce nothing 
    when use find "." or find "/a/")

v0.2.2: 
  * Changes the version to 0.2.2 in TopMakefile.in (closes: #33)
  * Stop removing Makefile in distclean target (closes: #31)
  * Change --enable-docdir --enable-builddir to --withXX (closes: #32)
  * Configure now test that ocamlfind is not detected and that we want to
    use ocamlfind (closes: #34)
  * Correct error concerning parsing of "" as a current dir (closes: #40)
  * Correct error concerning the test Has_extension (closes: #41)
  * Use a new CurrenDir of (Long|Short) to denote the difference between "" and "."
  * Implement readlink
  * Implement pwd (closes: #39)
  * Implement cmp (closes: #37, #38)
  * Implement new test: Has_no_extension | Basename_is | Dirname_is
  * Implement an anti recursion system (experimental, need to be tested) :
    * Use a type action_link: Follow, Skip, SkipInform, AskFollow
    * Maitain a set of visited directories
  * Implement new test: Is_older_than_date, Is_newer_than_date, Size_bigger_than,
    Size_smaller_than, Size_equal_to, Size_fuzzy_equal_to, Custom
  * Rewrite the test: Is_older_than, Is_newer_than, now takes only one args
  * Implement type size and operation coming along (add, sub, convert, compare,
    string_of_size).
  * Implement type permission / base_permission and operation coming along (
    permission_of_int, int_of_permission).
  * Implement type kind (Dir, File...).
  * Implement function stat 
  * Rewrite find, in order to be able to execute codes foreach filename. Very useful 
    for rewriting other functions (rm, cp, mv)
  * Use list argument in place of single filename for rm, cp
  * Fix a bug that prevent ls to be able to list ""
  * Reworked unitary tests: include test for symlink and anti recursion
  * Unitary tests change from Fort to OUnit test suite

v0.2.1:
  * Minor bug fixes to correct website aspect

v0.2:
  * Use module/functor to abstract a lot of operation.
  * Generate a decent ocamldoc documentation
  * Abstract regexp matching using functor
  * Separate the sysPath modules in two: Abstract and not. Abstract
    permits to parse once and for all the filename, and then operate
    on it. It allows to handle fast all operation. Concrete module 
    are only proxy that do the conversion to/from the Abstract 
    implementation.
  * Introduce relation (updir, subdir, compare) to allow manipulating
    filename in classical structure (Set, Map...)
  * Rename sysPath, sysUtil to filePath, fileUtil since it appears that it is 
    more consistent regarding the name of the library (i was not convinced, that 
    sysPath represents anything).

v0.1.1 (devel):

  * Fix some weird comportement with reduce (especially
    when trying to reduce filename which try to .. a root)
    and add the possibility to reduce relative filename
  * Rework on the way everything is made :
    * Support 4 different scheme of filename (Unix (the 
      native way), MacOS, Win32, Cygwin)
    * Each scheme use a parser/lexer to decompose his 
      filename and a .ml to handle the whole discriminant 
      element of a specific scheme (ie the way filename are
      decomposed and the way path like variable are decomposed)
    * All the operation are defined relatively to the 
      discriminant operation in a functorized module 
    * Each scheme produces a module from his discriminant element
      and from the generic operation. These modules are defined in
      SysPath.{UnixPath|Win32Path|CygwinPath|MacOSPath}.
    * Depending on the current environement one of the module above
      is the default binding for all the operation.
  * Add SysUtil which try to create some portable file operation :
    mv, cp, touch, mkdir, test, find. This module abandon any non
    cross platform operation and will never support it (ie links for 
    example, won't be supported).
  * This release is an alpha release. 0.2 will be the stable one.
